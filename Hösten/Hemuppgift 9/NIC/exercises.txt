Exercises for your edification

The numbers before each exercise are estimates of difficulty
and scope.

2. Write a program that multiplies every elements in an
   array with the same number.

5. Write a program that reverses the order of the elements
   in an array.

6. Write a program that translates degrees Fahrenheit to
   degrees Celsius. The program should work for all values
   from -95 to 127. Input and output to the program should
   come from RAM. (Hint: 5/9 ≈ 1/2 + 1/16.)

4. Count the number of nonzero bits in a word.

6. Count the number of nonzero bits in the whole memory.
   Try to reuse the code from the previous exercise.
   You will need two registers to store the result since
   the machine has a total of 1024 bits. Your program should
   finish within 10 seconds when the CPU is running at 1kHz.

2. Write a program that moves the word 0xff around in an
   interesting pattern in the lower half of the memory.

8. Write a program that makes a copy of itself and then
   executes the copy. Yes, your program will fill up the
   memory, over and over again.

6. Write a program that can add two four-byte integers
   in two's complement notation.

4-12. Design and implement a game for NIC.

2. Write a program that computes and prints (in RAM) the
   first thirteen Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

4. Write a program that starts with a positive number a[0]
   and prints (in RAM) the sequence a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., 1
   according to the rules:

   • if a[i] is even, a[i+1] = a[i] / 2;
   • if a[i] is odd, a[i+1] = 3a[i] + 1;
   • if a[i] = 1, stop.
   
   For example, starting with a[0] = 3, the sequence is
   3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
