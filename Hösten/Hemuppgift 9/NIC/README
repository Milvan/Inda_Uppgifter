This directory contains a simulator (nic), an assembler
(nas), example programs, and exercises for NIC, the Nada
Instructional Computer.

The two programs nic and nas are Java jar-files and can be
run as stand-alone binaries on any machine with a Java runtime
environment.

If your OS doesn't support direct execution of jar-files,
you may need to start the programs with "java -jar nic" and
"java -jar nas".
